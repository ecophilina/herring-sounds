PUBLIC HEALTH AND AQUACULTURE
Vessel Masters are reminded that there are numerous clam and oyster leases in Baynes Sound. Disposal of human waste into waters near shellfish harvest areas creates potentially serious health risks for shellfish consumers. The discharge of untreated sewage into all Canadian inland waters and Canadian coastal waters within 3 nautical miles of land is banned under the Canada Shipping Act. Vessels participating in the herring fishery are required to abide by sewage discharge regulations and are requested to minimize impact to aquaculture sites by utilizing marinas, anchoring in existing sanitary closures and minimizing congregations of vessels near shellfish aquaculture sites as much as possible.


NANAIMO PORT AUTHORITY NOTICE
All CFVs looking to moor at any Nanaimo Port Authority facility are required to hail the Marina Office on VHF Channel 67 prior to docking for a moorage assignment. All boats must register in person at the marina office once docked.
