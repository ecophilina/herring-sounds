# Column 	Metadata/annotation instructions
# filename - seek out wav file with this name, open it in Raven using herring presets (42, 55, 512â€¦) and paging to samp.tot.sec, and 100% for both subsequent options.
# samp.start.min - first page will be 0, second page = 1, etc.
# samp.tot.sec - tells you page resolution
# observer - provide initials for person doing annotation
# boat - score max for these options( 0 = silent, 1 = boat barely audible, 2 = boat noise evident, but some other noises usually still identifiable, 3 = boat is only thing audible for >10% of time
# waves - score max for these options( 0 = silent, 1 = waves barely audible, 2 = wave noise evident, but some other noises usually still identifiable, 3 = waves are only thing audible for >10% of time
# mechanical - score ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, but , 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# invert.snaps - score ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# sealion - score ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# herring.j - score frequency of distinct j shaped herring sounds ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# herring.v - score frequency of virtical lines representing herring sounds ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# herring.p - score frequency of other probable herring sounds including high frequency band of sound ( 0 = nothing identifiable as this, 1 = 1-5 discrete instances and <5% of time, 2 = >5 discrete instances and <10% of time, 3 = too many to count or overwhelming all other sounds >10% of time
# herr.notes - notes on characteristics of herring sounds, specifically ones classified as "p" other	any other sound identifiable (eg. Birds, people, other marine mammals)
# notes - notes on all other aspects of sound environment
